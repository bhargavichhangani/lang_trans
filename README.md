<h3>Python Language Translator:</h3>

This project aims to create a python program to read user text and convert it to the desired language.
We will use tkinter to create the graphical user interface.

<h3>Project Prerequisites:</h3>
The language translator project uses only two libraries, googletrans, and tkinter. To install googletrans through pip, use the following command:

pip install googletrans==3.1.0a0

Tkinter is a built-in GUI library in python, hence import to check if it is present.
